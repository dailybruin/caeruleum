                    <h1>LGBTQ students reconcile sexuality and religion</h1>
                    <h5>BY TALA AHMADI</h5>

      <div class="story-page" id="story-page-1">
          <p>Natalie Kirsten remembers wanting to be straight for most of her teenage years.

          <p>Growing up in a conservative Colorado town, Kirsten often thought her sexuality had to conform to the strict Christian ideals her community promoted, which included heterosexuality.</p>

          <p>But when she left home for UCLA, she started to feel different. She said she was able to embrace her sexuality for the first time because she felt accepted by other students. With this change, she said she came to the realization that her religion and sexual orientation weren't as conflicting as she thought.</p>

          <p>"These two parts of me, they work together," said Kirsten, a first-year undeclared student who identifies as lesbian and Christian. "My Christian identity just means that I love everybody... and my lesbian identity just means that I am attracted to women and I understand things a little differently."</p>

          <p>Kirsten now attends the Metropolitan Community Church in Los Feliz, which focuses on inclusivity of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and also caters to a predominantly LGBT congregation.</p>

          <p>Houses of worship that are geared toward the LGBT population are growing in numbers across the nation and signify increasing connections between the religious and LGBT communities, including among UCLA students.</p>

          <p>There are currently more than 6,700 LGBT affirming churches in the U.S., according to a church directory compiled by God's Agape Love (Put) Into Practice, a nonprofit organization.</p>

          <p>"During the last 50 years, we see some people being very harsh and bitter," said Father Chris Ponnet, spiritual director for the L.A. Archdiocese Office of Catholic Ministry with Lesbian and Gay Persons. "Now we are in a period of time where in the last eight or 10 years, civil society is beginning to look at what a committed relationship means in the gay and lesbian experience."</p>

          <p>Ponnet said that while the Catholic Church does not bless LGBT relationships, he thinks its outlook is changing.</p>

          <p>Reverend Doctor Neil Thomas, senior pastor at the Metropolitan Community Church, said he thinks stereotypes about the religious and LGBT communities being in conflict have roots in American culture.</p>

          <p>"I think that the dominant culture, especially in this country, is one that says 'thou shalt not.' You shalt not be a homosexual and a Christian," Thomas said. "Many LGBT people grow up with that rhetoric both from the Church and from culture."</p>

          <p>Reverend Michael Schuenemeyer, the United Church of Christ's executive for health and wholeness advocacy, said he thinks this stereotype is held by some members of the Christian community who have more conservative views. According to God's Agape Love (Put) Into Practice, the United Church of Christ has the most LGBT affirming churches in the U.S.</p>

          <p>He said many of the LGBT people he has worked with have felt alienated by some church leaders who took a "very rejective and abusive approach" to LGBT inclusion in the church.</p>

          <p>"But the Church is not God. The church is God's agent. It is a human institution, and it does not always get it right," Schuenemeyer said.</p>
      
          <p>Some LGBT UCLA students said they have felt rejected by members of the church in campus organizations.</p>

          <p>Steven Mion, a first-year political science student who identifies as gay and Methodist, said the first time he felt uncomfortable being with fellow Christians because of his sexuality was when he got to UCLA.</p>

          <p>Mion signed up for a Christian fellowship in the beginning of the school year without disclosing his sexuality. He said he remembers telling some members about his desire to incorporate more LGBT people in the church.</p>

          <p>The responses of the students in the fellowship left him surprised and confused, he said.</p>

          <p>"That was the first time, I'll never forget it, I ever heard the language of 'love the sinner, hate the sin,'" Mion said. "At that point, they didn't know they were addressing me as an LGBT person... and I had no idea how to respond."</p>

          <p>Despite this instance, Mion continued to attend the group's meetings, hoping to change the fellowship's perspective on being both Christian and gay.</p>

          <p>After a few more gatherings, he said he decided to be honest with the fellowship, so he told the lead pastor about his sexuality.</p>

          <p>Mion said the pastor responded by telling him that he was "broken."</p>

          <p>"It caught me off guard and it really scared me," Mion said. "When you say (being gay is) a sin, I can outright disagree with you and we can contest Bible verses. When you say it's broken... that means you are going to try and fix me, and that's scary."</p>

          <p>Mion said he never returned to the fellowship and instead found other groups on campus that were geared specifically toward the LGBT community.</p>

          <p>These groups include Cornerstone, a group for LGBT Christians sponsored by the University Catholic Center, and another similar small group sponsored by the InterVarsity Bruin Christian fellowship.</p>

          <p>Cornerstone has reached out to some of the other Christian groups on campus to converse with them, but none have accepted the offer so far, said Leiza Castillo, one of the co-leaders of Cornerstone and a third-year English student who identifies as lesbian and Catholic.</p>

          <p>The Daily Bruin contacted about 25 of the Christian groups on campus to ask about their stances on LGBT inclusion in the church. All but the Christian Social Work Caucus either declined to comment or could not be reached for this article.</p>

          <p>Jenny Rivas, the co-chair of the Christian Social Work Caucus and a graduate student in social welfare, said the club has no official stance on LGBT inclusion in the church and that it is welcoming to everyone, including members of the LGBT community.</p>

          <p>Students from several different religions said they also struggle with reconciling their faith with their sexuality.</p>

          <p>Sam Haws, a third-year economics student who identifies as gay and an agnostic theist, grew up in a strict Mormon household where he woke up every day at 6 a.m. to attend seminary, or Mormon church school.</p>
 
        <p>Haws said he thinks the high standards of the Mormon church made him who he is today, but he still finds some of the values of the Mormon Church limiting.</p>

        <p>"I got really incredible values from (the Mormon faith) but I think it is very damaging to grow up, especially when you are an LGBT person... in that environment and feel as though you can't explore who you are," Haws said.
        He added that he thinks the Mormon faith is becoming more accepting.</p>

        <p>"The Church still has its open stances against same sex marriage and homosexual activity... but the culture in general is changing," Haws said. "And that's what gives me so much hope, because I notice that it's about the people that make up any institution for me."</p>

        <p>Haws said he would be open to returning to the Mormon church one day, but only if he practiced a version of the religion that was more supportive of the LGBT community.</p>

        <p>While many national and campus religious groups consider LGBT issues taboo, some institutions are changing existing policies to promote inclusion.
        Kerry Chaplin, a rabbinic intern for Hillel at UCLA who identifies as lesbian and Jewish, is studying to be a rabbi at the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies. She began her studies there after a policy change in 2005 allowed applicants from the LGBT community to apply to be rabbis.</p>

        <p>Chaplin applied to rabbinical schools when she graduated college before the policy changed, but said she decided to withdraw her applications after realizing she would have to hide a part of herself.</p>

        <p>"I needed to be grounded in myself and have the freedom to move," Chaplin said. "I felt like I was grounded, but I didn't have the freedom to move."</p>

        <p>When she made the decision to withdraw her application, she said she found herself straying away from her Jewish faith.</p>

        <p>But working with a nonprofit multi-faith organization that aims to lift people out of difficult life circumstances brought her back to her religion. Through working with this organization, Chaplin said she realized she had to stop neglecting the religious aspect of her identity.
        "I decided to stop running from what was clearly the way I intended to bring Torah into this world and bring generative energy into this world," Chaplin said.</p>

        <p>Chaplin reapplied to the Ziegler School in 2008 and has one more year left before completing her studies there.</p>

        <p>For Mion, instead of trying to change the views of student groups that are not inclusive for the LGBT community, he plans to show his dedication to both the Christian and LGBT communities by following the lessons in the Bible and simultaneously embracing his sexuality.</p>

        <p>"To me, the genuine form of outreach in ministry is to model it," Mion said. "If you are living as a model to that, as a testament to God's love... that's a more compelling conversation of what it means to have faith and a relationship with God."</p>

              <p>In one year, Leiza Castillo went from being an atheist to one of the co-leaders of an LGBT Catholic group.</p>

              <p>Castillo, a third-year English student who identifies as lesbian and Catholic, immigrated from the Philippines to the United States when she was five years old. She said she was raised Catholic, but her family lost touch with their faith when they got to the U.S.</p>

              <p>About a year ago, she returned to her faith after attending a Bible study at UCLA, where the story of Jesus inspired her.</p>

              <p>"I didn't feel so loved growing up, and hearing the story of Jesus Christ dying on the cross for human beings - for us - stirred up something in me... that I really could be loved by this person," Castillo said.</p>

              <p>As Castillo embraced her sexuality and returned to Catholicism, she said she experienced backlash from some in the LGBT community who thought it was wrong to be both Christian and gay.</p>

              <p>"I feel like the LGBTQ community thinks Christians are there to convert them and to tell them that their identity is not real," Castillo said. "There is a lot of resentment, I feel, in the LGBTQ community against Christianity."</p>

              <p>Castillo said she faced this resentment by trying to understand her role in God's eyes.</p>

              <p>"I am perfectly content to be scorned or disliked or hated for what I say because I know God's love is the one (that) matters in the end," Castillo said.</p>

              <p>Kerry Chaplin still remembers picking up the phone about 10 years ago to break the news to two rabbinical schools she desperately wanted to attend. She told them she needed to withdraw her application because she was gay and wasn't allowed to apply.</p>

		<p>Even when the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies changed its policy in 2005 to allow applications from members of the LGBT community, Chaplin, a rabbinic intern for Hillel at UCLA, distanced herself from her faith.</p>

		<p>Chaplin said she spent the next few years after withdrawing her application trying to answer some of her biggest questions in life.</p>

		<p>"I wanted to go find my 'why'... It is the framework for life, it is the framework for understanding our world and how we deal with suffering and vulnerability and being so small and so powerful at the same time," Chaplin said. "I was looking for that."</p>

		<p>The answer to this question eventually brought Chaplin back to her faith, and in 2008, she was accepted to the Ziegler School.</p>

		<p>Chaplin said the process of returning to her faith after being excluded from it was not easy, but she decided she would embrace her religion and try to understand what it really meant to her.</p>

		<p>"(One) option is to say that piece of me that seeks religion... is mine, and now I'm going to figure out what (it) actually looks like," Chaplin said.</p>

		<p>Merry Drake sleeps on the floor of their friend's dorm some nights to attend the late-night meetings for the three campus Christian groups they are a part of.</p>

		<p>Achieving this comfort with their religion took Drake, a third-year mathematics student who identifies as bisexual and genderqueer, a while to achieve.</p>

		<p>When they first realized their sexuality, Drake said they felt like some members of the LGBT community resented them and Christianity.</p>

		<p>Drake said they remember wondering if they were "coming out of one closet to jump into another" after members of the community expressed some discrimination toward them.</p>

		<p>But Drake said they were able reconcile these two parts of their identity by contemplating the gospel of Jesus.</p>

		<p>"If it's really our goal to live life as Christ lived his, then our mission should really be one of love," Drake said.</p>

		<p>Sam Haws remembers campaigning with his family to ban gay marriage in California in 2008.</p>

		<p>Just a few years later, he told them he was gay.</p>

		<p>Haws, a third-year economics student who identifies as gay and an agnostic theist, grew up in a strict Mormon household that, while he said was unconditionally loving, had difficulty accepting his sexuality.</p>

		<p>Haws said his sister came out to his parents when he was 12 years old, and her experience helped pave the way for him.</p>

		<p>"Having her example definitely was a big part of me learning how to accept myself," Haws said. "Seeing what she had done and how hard it was for her, it was easier for me to navigate."</p>

		<p>Haws said he has learned to not let any environment suppress his identity if he wants to be totally comfortable with who he is.</p>

		<p>"When I go home... I try to not let those feelings of my childhood and teenage-hood come back, of feeling invalid or dissatisfied with myself or uncomfortable or just wrong," Haws said.</p>

		<p>Haws added that when he is at UCLA, he thinks some people try to push him away from being open about his faith.</p>

		<p>"You need to really critically question yourself... do you feel like there is something in your life that you are missing... or holding onto that doesn't really have the right to make you feel that way?" Haws said.</p>

		<p>For Shen Heckel, abandoning his faith was never an option. It was his emerging sexuality that he wanted to run away from.</p> 

		<p>Heckel, a UCLA alumnus who identifies as Catholic and a transgender man, said he wondered if he still belonged in the church after realizing his true identity.</p>

		<p>Despite Heckel's perceived divide between the Catholic and transgender communities, he said he eventually found peace by connecting with someone who was going through a similar experience.</p>

		<p>"I kept praying and hoping to find someone that I could relate to... and I ended up finding someone that was transgender and Catholic," Heckel said. "I think he really helped me through (coming out)... We were able to talk about both worlds and have emotional connections to both worlds. It made me feel like I am not alone."</p>

		<p>Heckel said he thinks this relationship brought him closer to his faith.</p>

		<p>"The stronger connection I have with myself being transgender, the stronger connection I have with actually being Catholic," Heckel said.</p>

		<p>Now, Heckel said he is committed to sharing his story to help others who may be struggling through the same situation he did. He also currently participates as a catechist,teaching Catholic scripture at the University Catholic Center.</p>

		<p>The gay-straight alliance club at Natalie Kirsten's 2,000-student high school consisted of three people.</p>

		<p>"Nobody talked about (the LGBT community)... Nobody was out to their parents. It wasn't accepted," said Kirsten, a first-year undeclared student who identifies as lesbian and Christian.</p>

		<p>Kirsten said she grew up in a conservative town in Colorado, where she felt she had to suppress her sexuality in favor of her religion.</p>

		<p>She said her solid dedication to her faith manifested itself after undergoing a life-threatening experience when she was younger.</p> 

		<p>When she was 13, Kirstenwas hit by a car and spent 12 days in the hospital because of a severe brain injury. Her stay included three days in the Intensive Care Unit.</p>

		<p>"Over my healing process, I discovered that I was healing really quickly and really well and I could feel God's presence in my life at that point, so my faith was something I could never abandon," she said.</p>

		<p>Kirsten said her sexuality was more accepted at UCLA, and she was overwhelmed by the new opportunities she had to learn about Christianity.</p>

		<p>Now that she is comfortable with both her faith and her sexuality, Kirsten said she wants to focus on spreading God's love.</p>

		<p>"God has blessed me so much, I can't deny his presence and I need to continue to filter his love and to just spread that to other people so that they can feel loved as well," Kirsten said.</p>

		<p>When Steven Mion came out in high school he had the full support of his family and church, who he said were overwhelmingly accepting of the LGBT community.</p>

		<p>"I don't think I appreciated that I got a huge burden off my shoulders at the time... A lot of people found resistance there, and I could find support. I could find affirmation there," said Mion, afirst-year political science student who identifies as gay andMethodist.</p>

		<p>Mion said that his experience with some members of Christian groups on campus who said they wanted to "fix"or "help" him because of his sexuality presented a stark contrast to the environment he grew up in.</p>

		<p>"I really did have enough of a strong confidence and self-love and affirmation in God at that point... to not take a personal blow," Mion said."What (some church members reactions) really did was show me (that) there was a real division."</p>

		<p>Mion said he hopes to share his story to break stereotypes that promote conflict between the religious and LGBT communities.</p>
