                    <h1>LGBTQ students reconcile sexuality and religion</h1>
                    <h5>BY TALA AHMADI</h5>

      <div class="story-page" id="story-page-1">
          <p>Natalie Kirsten remembers wanting to be straight for most of her teenage years.

          <p>Growing up in a conservative Colorado town, Kirsten often thought her sexuality had to conform to the strict Christian ideals her community promoted, which included heterosexuality.</p>

          <p>But when she left home for UCLA, she started to feel different. She said she was able to embrace her sexuality for the first time because she felt accepted by other students. With this change, she said she came to the realization that her religion and sexual orientation weren't as conflicting as she thought.</p>

          <p>"These two parts of me, they work together," said Kirsten, a first-year undeclared student who identifies as lesbian and Christian. "My Christian identity just means that I love everybody... and my lesbian identity just means that I am attracted to women and I understand things a little differently."</p>

          <p>Kirsten now attends the Metropolitan Community Church in Los Feliz, which focuses on inclusivity of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and also caters to a predominantly LGBT congregation.</p>

          <p>Houses of worship that are geared toward the LGBT population are growing in numbers across the nation and signify increasing connections between the religious and LGBT communities, including among UCLA students.</p>

          <p>There are currently more than 6,700 LGBT affirming churches in the U.S., according to a church directory compiled by God's Agape Love (Put) Into Practice, a nonprofit organization.</p>

          <p>"During the last 50 years, we see some people being very harsh and bitter," said Father Chris Ponnet, spiritual director for the L.A. Archdiocese Office of Catholic Ministry with Lesbian and Gay Persons. "Now we are in a period of time where in the last eight or 10 years, civil society is beginning to look at what a committed relationship means in the gay and lesbian experience."</p>

          <p>Ponnet said that while the Catholic Church does not bless LGBT relationships, he thinks its outlook is changing.</p>

          <p>Reverend Doctor Neil Thomas, senior pastor at the Metropolitan Community Church, said he thinks stereotypes about the religious and LGBT communities being in conflict have roots in American culture.</p>

          <p>"I think that the dominant culture, especially in this country, is one that says 'thou shalt not.' You shalt not be a homosexual and a Christian," Thomas said. "Many LGBT people grow up with that rhetoric both from the Church and from culture."</p>

          <p>Reverend Michael Schuenemeyer, the United Church of Christ's executive for health and wholeness advocacy, said he thinks this stereotype is held by some members of the Christian community who have more conservative views. According to God's Agape Love (Put) Into Practice, the United Church of Christ has the most LGBT affirming churches in the U.S.</p>

          <p>He said many of the LGBT people he has worked with have felt alienated by some church leaders who took a "very rejective and abusive approach" to LGBT inclusion in the church.</p>

          <p>"But the Church is not God. The church is God's agent. It is a human institution, and it does not always get it right," Schuenemeyer said.</p>
      
          <p>Some LGBT UCLA students said they have felt rejected by members of the church in campus organizations.</p>

          <p>Steven Mion, a first-year political science student who identifies as gay and Methodist, said the first time he felt uncomfortable being with fellow Christians because of his sexuality was when he got to UCLA.</p>

          <p>Mion signed up for a Christian fellowship in the beginning of the school year without disclosing his sexuality. He said he remembers telling some members about his desire to incorporate more LGBT people in the church.</p>

          <p>The responses of the students in the fellowship left him surprised and confused, he said.</p>

          <p>"That was the first time, I'll never forget it, I ever heard the language of 'love the sinner, hate the sin,'" Mion said. "At that point, they didn't know they were addressing me as an LGBT person... and I had no idea how to respond."</p>

          <p>Despite this instance, Mion continued to attend the group's meetings, hoping to change the fellowship's perspective on being both Christian and gay.</p>

          <p>After a few more gatherings, he said he decided to be honest with the fellowship, so he told the lead pastor about his sexuality.</p>

          <p>Mion said the pastor responded by telling him that he was "broken."</p>

          <p>"It caught me off guard and it really scared me," Mion said. "When you say (being gay is) a sin, I can outright disagree with you and we can contest Bible verses. When you say it's broken... that means you are going to try and fix me, and that's scary."</p>

          <p>Mion said he never returned to the fellowship and instead found other groups on campus that were geared specifically toward the LGBT community.</p>

          <p>These groups include Cornerstone, a group for LGBT Christians sponsored by the University Catholic Center, and another similar small group sponsored by the InterVarsity Bruin Christian fellowship.</p>

          <p>Cornerstone has reached out to some of the other Christian groups on campus to converse with them, but none have accepted the offer so far, said Leiza Castillo, one of the co-leaders of Cornerstone and a third-year English student who identifies as lesbian and Catholic.</p>

          <p>The Daily Bruin contacted about 25 of the Christian groups on campus to ask about their stances on LGBT inclusion in the church. All but the Christian Social Work Caucus either declined to comment or could not be reached for this article.</p>

          <p>Jenny Rivas, the co-chair of the Christian Social Work Caucus and a graduate student in social welfare, said the club has no official stance on LGBT inclusion in the church and that it is welcoming to everyone, including members of the LGBT community.</p>

          <p>Students from several different religions said they also struggle with reconciling their faith with their sexuality.</p>

          <p>Sam Haws, a third-year economics student who identifies as gay and an agnostic theist, grew up in a strict Mormon household where he woke up every day at 6 a.m. to attend seminary, or Mormon church school.</p>
 
        <p>Haws said he thinks the high standards of the Mormon church made him who he is today, but he still finds some of the values of the Mormon Church limiting.</p>

        <p>"I got really incredible values from (the Mormon faith) but I think it is very damaging to grow up, especially when you are an LGBT person... in that environment and feel as though you can't explore who you are," Haws said.
        He added that he thinks the Mormon faith is becoming more accepting.</p>

        <p>"The Church still has its open stances against same sex marriage and homosexual activity... but the culture in general is changing," Haws said. "And that's what gives me so much hope, because I notice that it's about the people that make up any institution for me."</p>

        <p>Haws said he would be open to returning to the Mormon church one day, but only if he practiced a version of the religion that was more supportive of the LGBT community.</p>

        <p>While many national and campus religious groups consider LGBT issues taboo, some institutions are changing existing policies to promote inclusion.
        Kerry Chaplin, a rabbinic intern for Hillel at UCLA who identifies as lesbian and Jewish, is studying to be a rabbi at the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies. She began her studies there after a policy change in 2005 allowed applicants from the LGBT community to apply to be rabbis.</p>

        <p>Chaplin applied to rabbinical schools when she graduated college before the policy changed, but said she decided to withdraw her applications after realizing she would have to hide a part of herself.</p>

        <p>"I needed to be grounded in myself and have the freedom to move," Chaplin said. "I felt like I was grounded, but I didn't have the freedom to move."</p>

        <p>When she made the decision to withdraw her application, she said she found herself straying away from her Jewish faith.</p>

        <p>But working with a nonprofit multi-faith organization that aims to lift people out of difficult life circumstances brought her back to her religion. Through working with this organization, Chaplin said she realized she had to stop neglecting the religious aspect of her identity.
        "I decided to stop running from what was clearly the way I intended to bring Torah into this world and bring generative energy into this world," Chaplin said.</p>

        <p>Chaplin reapplied to the Ziegler School in 2008 and has one more year left before completing her studies there.</p>

        <p>For Mion, instead of trying to change the views of student groups that are not inclusive for the LGBT community, he plans to show his dedication to both the Christian and LGBT communities by following the lessons in the Bible and simultaneously embracing his sexuality.</p>

        <p>"To me, the genuine form of outreach in ministry is to model it," Mion said. "If you are living as a model to that, as a testament to God's love... that's a more compelling conversation of what it means to have faith and a relationship with God."</p>

		<p>Kerry Chaplin"ok (3)" still remembers picking up the phone about 10 years ago to break the news to two rabbinical schools she desperately wanted to attend. She told them she needed to withdraw her application because she was gay and wasn't allowed to apply.</p>

		<p>Even when the Ziegler School of Rabbinic"changed from "Rabbinical" (2)" Studies changed its policy in 2005"Chaplin gave this info in interview" to allow applications from members of the LGBT community"ok (2)", Chaplin, a rabbinic intern for Hillel at UCLA"verified with author (she sent link) ", distanced herself from her faith.</p>

		<p>Chaplin said she spent the next few years after withdrawing her application trying to answer some of her biggest questions in life."deleted ", like why justice exists""</p>

		<p>"I wanted to go find my 'why'... It is the framework for life, it is the framework for understanding our world and how we deal with suffering and vulnerability and being so small and so powerful at the same time," Chaplin said. "I was looking for that."</p>

		<p>The answer to this question eventually brought Chaplin back to her faith, and in 2008"ASK WRITER are we sure? because her Facebook status on (3) dated Dec 29 2009 says she just sent in her app.", she was accepted to the Ziegler"changed from Zeigler" School.</p>

		<p>Chaplin said the process of returning to her faith after being excluded from it was not easy, but she decided she would embrace her religion and try to understand what it really meant to her.</p>

		<p>"(One) option is to say that piece of me that seeks religion... is mine,"added comma" and now I'm going to figure out what (it) actually looks like," Chaplin said.</p>
