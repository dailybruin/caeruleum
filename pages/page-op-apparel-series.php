				    <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he University of California has a listening problem. </p><p>Last summer, the opportunity to commit UC apparel licensees to more stringent labor codes arose. Instead of doing so, policymakers made a commitment of passive leniency. And what's worse, individual UCs seem barred from disagreement. </p><p>The rise and fall of these ethical standards began with a historic controversy with JanSport &#8211; one of UCLA's main licensees.</p>
<p>In April 2013 there was a disastrous <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/world/asia/bangladesh-building-collapse.html?_r=2">building collapse</a> in Dhaka, Bangladesh. More than 1,000 people died and more than 2,000 were injured. The Rana Plaza building housed several factories.</p>
<p>The collapse spurred the creation of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://bangladeshaccord.org/about/">Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh</a>. The Accord is a legally binding agreement between brands and trade unions to ensure worker safety, disclose factory locations, allow independent inspections and commit to remediation. The Accord is signed by over 200 brands, retailers from over 20 countries, two global trade unions, eight Bangladesh trade unions and four nongovernmental organization witnesses. It is also endorsed by the Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) and United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS).</p>
<img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2016/01/map.png"/>
<p>VF Corporation, the parent company of JanSport, refused to sign the Accord and responded by joining the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bangladeshworkersafety.org/">Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety</a>.</p><p>VF Corporation is a founding and funding member of the Alliance. Even more dubious is that the Alliance is neither legally binding nor obligates signatories to financial remediation. The Alliance has also had <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://portside.org/2015-02-02/student-campaign-forces-16-universities-end-sweatshop-contracts-over-abuses-bangladeshi">differing</a> factory inspection results compared to the Accord.</p><p>During all this time the UC system was monitoring the developments.</p><p>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ucop.edu/sustainability/programs-initiatives/social-sustainability/uc-code-of-conduct-for-trademark-licensees-steering-committee.html">UC Code of Conduct for Trademark Licensees Steering Committee</a> listened to representatives from both the Accord and the Alliance. After a year of <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ucop.edu/sustainability/_files/social-sustainability/uc-code-committee-recommendation-re-bangladesh-2014.pdf">investigation</a>, the committee unanimously voted for all UCs to adopt the Accord. But in June, University of California President Janet Napolitano decided <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ucop.edu/sustainability/_files/social-sustainability/response-to-committee-recommendation-2014.pdf">differently</a>.</p><p>The Alliance is an embarrassingly poor imitation of the Accord. Licensing companies that are part of the Alliance is an affront to the honest efforts of Accord members and an affront to the moral standards of the UC system. <b></b>The UCs need to be committed to the Accord alone.</p><p>The decision by the UC president came as a surprise and disappointment. <br /></p><p>&#8220;Just like that, the unanimous opinion of the committee was reversed,&#8221; says Richard Appelbaum, a UC Santa Barbara faculty member of the UC Code of Conduct Steering Committee.</p><p>The reversal was supposedly justified by stating that both the Alliance and Accord have seen progress since inception. But more obviously, the tangible evidence and data from a devoted committee&#8217;s work was seemingly overturned by vacuous pleas.</p><p>&#8220;The head of the Alliance sent a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ucop.edu/sustainability/_files/social-sustainability/uc-code-committee-recommendation-re-bangladesh-2014.pdf">letter</a> to the [UC] president where it says not to believe the allegations made by the WRC and USAS,&#8221; said Appelbaum.</p><p>The UC president also received a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ucop.edu/sustainability/_files/social-sustainability/uc-code-committee-recommendation-re-bangladesh-2014.pdf">letter</a> from the CEO of VF Corporation stating the company has been &#8220;wrongly and unfairly targeted by USAS&#8221; and that &#8220;we consistently place worker safety as a high priority in every factory.&#8221;</p><p>Unanimity &#8211; difficult to achieve on any issue &#8211; reflects the seriousness of VF Corporation&#8217;s violations. But the break from this recommendation gives doubt as to how loudly these ethical concerns are heard in the first place, not to mention a conflict of interests.<br /></p><p>But the story doesn&#8217;t end there. When UCSB tried to hold its licensees to only the Accord, it was barred from doing so.</p><p>During the summer of 2015, the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/">UCSB</a> chapter of USAS urged the school to pull JanSport products from its bookstore. After the announcement from the UCOP, Appelbaum and USAS then led an initiative for UCSB to comply solely with the Accord &#8211; breaking the UC-wide policy.</p><p>&#8220;The students and board supported it unanimously and we thought it would be OK to hold UCSB [and licensees] to a higher standard,&#8221; said Appelbaum. &#8220;But the UC legal office ruling said that the decision [by the UC president for the UCs] was binding.&#8221;</p><p>The message was clear: no single UC should break from the UC-wide policy on trademark licensing.</p><p>Other U.S. universities responded much earlier and more definitively to infringements by VF Corporation.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2014/05/06/nyu-puts-hold-on-new-orders-of-jansport-merchandise.html">NYU</a> put all new orders with JanSport on hold in May 2014. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-10-20/students-push-cornell-to-end-vf-corp-deals-over-labor-practices">Cornell</a> cut ties with JanSport in October 2014.<b> </b>By February 2015, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://portside.org/2015-02-02/student-campaign-forces-16-universities-end-sweatshop-contracts-over-abuses-bangladeshi">16 U.S. universities</a> had cut ties with JanSport, and by November 2015, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://northfacedeathtraps.com/2015/11/02/victory-purdue-severs-ties-with-jansport/">22 universities</a> had cut ties with VF Corporation. JanSport remains licensed through UCLA.</p><p>VF Corporation's negligence concerning worker safety in Bangladesh will most likely continue. VF Corporation continues to ignore demands and would rather face financial losses from the college market than acknowledge accountability.</p>
<p>The political, economic and ethical interests overlap greatly in these issues. I do not pretend that I am knowledgeable enough to confidently recommend whether it is more within the University&#8217;s interests to cut ties or negotiate with JanSport. </p><p>But an immediate action is clear: UC licensees should be required to adhere to the Accord. </p>
<p>The announcement requiring UCs to adop<i>t </i>either the Accord or the Alliance was a mistake, and it diminished the UC Code of Conduct Steering Committee's entire year of work. It is hard enough to investigate and substantiate the histories of apparel companies, but those efforts become worthless and despairing if policymakers do not even listen to these findings.</p>
<p>Labor rights abuses in the garment industry are living and widespread. Change amidst large apparel companies is slow and incremental because we are fighting economic incentive. And change becomes harder to realize the more we grow complicit and impassive. The opportunity to preferentially adopt the Accord among the UCs was a rare chance, but through rare chances come the beginning of change. Last year, we lost this chance. </p><p>Drop the Alliance and perhaps we can redeem that chance.</p>

				  <h3 class="part2"> UCLA Athletics must examine brand accountability in apparel deals </h1>
				  	<iframe src='//cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1jJpIK4nOPzSbDe0L51SuRjyj7U55PiHgi6bzyZRoTaw&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' frameborder='0'></iframe>
				    <p class="first-paragraph"><span class="dropcap">U</span>CLA Athletics has a huge decision to make. And it has nothing to do with athletes.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/could-ucla-be-next-to-leave-adidas-070715" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">2017</a>, the licensing contract between <span class="s2"><a href="http://www.adidas.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adidas</a></span> and UCLA Athletics is set to be renewed or terminated.</p>

<p>Inevitably, speculations will begin to circulate as to whether UCLA will continue its relationship with Adidas or switch to another competing brand. Perhaps we will license <a href="http://www.nike.com/language_tunnel" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nike</a> and follow in the footsteps of other <span class="s2">Pac-12 members</span>. Or maybe, if unexpectedly, <span class="s2"><a href="https://www.underarmour.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Under Armour</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="s1">But beneath all of these brands lies the sordid not-so-secret </span><span class="s1">secret of the garment industry: a torrent of labor rights abuses, worker safety violations and infringements on worker freedoms.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">This is a widely known reality. And yet it has lost its urgency. <b></b>UCLA Athletics has a duty to recall the breadth of the violations beneath Adidas </span>– or any major brand it licenses. Athletics should consider a split from Adidas entirely and a jump to Under Armour. If this is impossible, then a renewed contract with Adidas must come with additional bargaining that assesses improved labor conditions over time.</p>

<p><span class="s1">There are few other legitimate alternatives for universities with competitive sports teams. Few, if any, companies are equipped to provide the need for custom uniforms, equipment, mass orders and delivery to schools as large as UCLA.<b></p>
</b></span>

<p><span class="s1">Which means that economics has become tangled with politics and ethics. So there is a very precarious balance between pushing apparel companies to meet better standards while still maintaining a safe business.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">But it's evident that the imbalance has shifted too far toward the employer. To start, let's look at Adidas' recent history.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">In late 2010, labor rights violations began to worsen at the <a href="http://www.cleanclothes.org/news/2012/05/09/background-on-pt-kizone-indonesia" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">PT Kizone</span></a> factory in Indonesia. In April 2011, the owner fled and the factory closed without paying an estimated $1.8 million in severance pay to 2,800 workers. Adidas reportedly produced through PT Kizone throughout this time.</span></p>

<p>The incident was assessed by the <a href="https://www.uwosh.edu/fairtrade/wrc/WRC-Assessment-PTKIZONE-2012.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Worker Rights Consortium </a>– the major independent monitoring organization that investigates and reports on labor rights at factories producing for global collegiate apparel brands. Adidas refused to financially contribute a cent of due severance. Nike paid $500,000.</p>

<p>Then, things got awkward for Adidas in 2012 when a number of new violations came to light.</p>

<p><span class="s1">In April, near the London Olympic Games, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/exposed-the-reality-behind-londons-ethical-olympics-7644013.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">allegations</span></a> flew that the Great Britain team uniforms manufactured by Adidas came from sweatshops.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">In <span class="s2"><a href="http://www.union-league.org/pt_panarub_dwikarya_workers_protest_for_their_rights_and_all_adidas_workers" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">July</a>, four more incidents erupted in the media.</span></span></p>

<p><span class="s1">More than a thousand workers were fired after going on strike at the PT Panarub Industry factory in Indonesia. The company was the main global manufacturer of Adidas soccer cleats.</span></p>

<p>More than a hundred workers contracted occupational diseases from unsafe working conditions at Dynamica Casting in Guangzhou, China. The company produced golf clubs for Adidas' TaylorMade Golf Company.</p>

<p><span class="s1">Workers suffering from occupational benzene poisoning demanded medical attention and compensation at the Xingang Shoe Company in Dongguan, China. Benzene is a carcinogen found in glues used for shoe manufacturing. This company produced footwear for Adidas.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Simultaneous <a href="http://laborrightsblog.typepad.com/international_labor_right/2012/08/simultaneous-labor-protests-in-four-countries-target-hemispheres-largest-supplier-of-adidas-and-nike.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">protests</span></a> also took place in four Central American countries and Caribbean islands over labor rights violations toward Gildan Activewear. Gildan Activewear was Adidas and Nike’s biggest supplier in the Western Hemisphere.</span></p>

<p>By then some U.S. universities began to question their relationship with Adidas. <span class="s2"><a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/universities-dump-adidas-over-labor-disputes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cornell University cut ties</a></span> completely.</p>

<p>And during this time, <a href="http://usas.org/2013/04/24/victory-badidas-campaign-forces-adidas-to-respect-indonesian-garment-worker-rights/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">United Students Against Sweatshops </a>was conducting a “Badidas” campaign to force Adidas to compensate the workers of PT Kizone. Amid international pressure, the campaign ended in <span class="s2"><a href="http://usas.org/2013/04/24/victory-badidas-campaign-forces-adidas-to-respect-indonesian-garment-worker-rights/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">victory.</a></span></p>

<p>Adidas has a fresh history of failing to defend its workers overseas. These workers are not guaranteed a living wage, safe working conditions, the right to organize or bargain nor due severance or compensation.</p>

<p><span class="s1">So would Nike be the lesser of the two evils? Think again.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Nike has a notorious sweatshop image that stretches back to the <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/ccce/polcommcampaigns/NikeChronology.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">1990s</span></a>. I will not go into detail here about its history because UCLA Athletics does not license Nike. But take it as an assertion that Nike seems no better than Adidas. Issues of <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/may/20/burhanwazir.theobserver" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">low wages</span></a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/2005/apr/14/ethicalbusiness.money" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">forced over-time</span></a> and verbal and physical <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2014325/Nike-workers-kicked-slapped-verbally-abused-factories-making-Converse-line-Indonesia.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">abuse</span></a> return throughout the years. USAS ran a successful campaign against Nike in <a href="http://justpayit.usas.org/2010/07/26/nike-just-pays-it/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">2010</span></a> for failing to pay severance to workers in Honduras.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">The only claim that Nike could possibly make over Adidas is greater transparency. In the past decade Nike has <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/7480688/ns/business-us_business/t/nike-reveals-overseas-factory-names-locations/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">disclosed</span></a> its overseas factories, acknowledged issues with labor safety and worked with organizations like the WRC to improve worker conditions.</span></p>

<p>That is, until now.</p>

<p><span class="s1">In <span class="s2"><a href="http://www.workersrights.org/university/memo/111715.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">November</a>,</span> Nike informed the WRC that it will no longer allow them to independently monitor their factories that produce collegiate apparel. This was reaffirmed in <a href="http://www.workersrights.org/university/memo/120715.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">December </span></a> when Nike communicated to universities that the WRC was not allowed to access or assess their supplier factories. Only organizations approved by Nike itself, such as the <a href="http://www.fairlabor.org/our-work/labor-standards" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span class="s2">Fair Labor Association</span></a>, are entitled to such privileges.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Nike is a giant. If it is allowed to keep this decision, it will encourage other companies to do the same. Supporting or licensing Nike at this time is to all but endorse labor rights violations.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Which leaves us with Under Armour.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">I could not find a single article detailing labor rights abuses at factories for Under Armour.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">However, that doesn’t mean Under Armou</span>r has no violations. It is a younger company and may possibly not be subject to the same scrutiny. And, more importantly, many companies produce through the same factories or regions.</p>

<p><span class="s1">“Because most brands rely on a globalized model of manufacturing, the odds are that one [brand’s production] isn’t better than the other,” said <a href="http://usas.org/about/national-leadership/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Morgan Currier</a>, a national organizer for USAS.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Universities are fighting against the shared and far-reaching power of sports apparel companies. And while UCLA holds itself to higher standards, it is difficult to coerce companies to do the same.</span></p>

<p class="quote"><span class="s1">“The problem is within the entire market for, say, Adidas, the college market is small. And within the college market, the UCLA market is even smaller,” said </span><span class="s2"><a href="http://legacy.asucla.ucla.edu/management.asp?bio=ph&amp;showbio=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Patrick Healey</a></span><span class="s1">, the ASUCLA director of apparel and accessories</span>. “We prefer to maintain our relationships with these companies so that we can still work on these issues.”</p>

<p><span class="s1">Healey also said that there is movement toward better accountability though the process is moving slowly. And this process goes back to a question of balance. The ultimate goal is to hold apparel companies to better standards, but this goal comes with a trade-off. Sometimes it is better to cut ties with a company. Other times it is more worthwhile to continue a loyal relationship and build incremental change. And this trade-off is a balance of ethical, professional, economic and political interests.</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">Alone, the most UCLA can do is push for better accountability from companies at a glacial pace. It will take united momentum from student campaigns, economic alternatives and multiple universities </span>– no small feats in themselves. But this begins with smaller efforts from UCLA Athletics. It is not enough for one party to care – we have to care together.</p>

<p><span class="s1">But even if they care<b>, </b>UCLA Athletics must be more transparent in their calculation of interests. When asked about future licenses, they released this statement: “UCLA Athletics is currently in a long-term, multi-sport shoe and apparel contract with Adidas, and discussing industry competitors would be inappropriate.” <b></b>Without transparency, we cannot know the degree to which ethical interests and standards are represented.</span></p>

<p>As for the immediate future of the sports contract, Under Armour is our best bet for a more ethical licensee. While the company probably has labor issues, it does not have the history of abuse or negligence like Nike or Adidas. They may even be more amenable to improvement.</p>

<p>Do not dare do business with Nike at this time. If UCLA licenses the company, then we are all but endorsing labor rights violations. If we must do business, then Nike must allow the WRC access to Nike's suppliers.</p>

<p>If there are no other options then, for now, license Adidas. But do so with the understanding that the company must work to fit UCLA's commitment to higher standards of accountability.</p>

<p><span class="s1">It is never easy, but UCLA must continue to uphold its standards, values and code of conduct. And while UCLA is trying diligently, we cannot let these issues fade into a monotonous background. We have to revisit the history of these issues again year after year to assess what has changed. If we teach accountability, we must practice it too. And that responsibility only grows with this school.</span></p>

					</figure>
				    <p class="first-paragraph"><b></b><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen it comes to consumerism, the ethical standards of UCLA may be higher than those of its own students. <br /></p><p><b></b>In the past two weeks I have written columns exploring UCLA's licensing agreements and the labor violations behind these licensed apparel companies. The garment industry has a rampant history of worker rights infringements &#8211; incidents that still persist today. In past years, UCLA has continuously worked with these companies to hold them to higher moral standards and labor codes.</p>
					<p>The difficulty is that the university relies on energy from student campaigns to enforce these ethical commitments. Student indifference restricts the school's negotiating power. </p><p><b></b>Universities are an exhibition of many businesses which depend upon direction from consumers. Among these many businesses are partnerships with many apparel licensees. And while we are students, we are also consumers.<b><br /></b></p><p>Socially responsible behavior is an economic imperative in our globalized reality. The fate of the college marketplace lies in the decisions of students. As inconsequential as a single consumer may seem, consciously ethical consumers are collectively very powerful. <b></b></p><p>Students are the momentum behind pushing collegiate companies towards ethical commitment. We control the fading or reification of morality. And more importantly, this student energy is necessary to elicit change. <b></b>In order to make it easier for universities to hold companies accountable, students need to enhance their own accountability by being more ethical consumers. </p><p>Student fervor has been very effective in past campaign events. This past summer, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://dailynexus.com/2015-06-04/students-demand-that-bookstore-discontinue-jansport-products/">students at UCSB</a> affiliated with United Students Against Sweatshops (USAS) successfully pushed the school to drop JanSport products from the bookstore. In <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://usas.org/2013/04/24/victory-badidas-campaign-forces-adidas-to-respect-indonesian-garment-worker-rights/">2013</a>, international pressure from numerous universities led to a successful campaign for Adidas to compensate a group of unpaid workers. And in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://justpayit.usas.org/2010/07/26/nike-just-pays-it/">2010</a>, students with USAS helped lead a successful campaign against Nike to meet worker demands.</p><p>The link with students is clear: Every national campaign against apparel companies has begun with, or been strengthened by, the efforts of ethically conscious students. Students are an instrumental part of initiating change &#8211; especially because of how UCLA chooses to partner with apparel companies.</p><p>As a university, it is more worthwhile to work with licensees to incrementally increase their ethical commitment. Over time, this relationship builds to accommodate higher university standards while still keeping business. This is an admirable leadership quality, though it is often hard to see its workings because of the slow process.</p><p>It is also better than alternative choices like cutting ties with apparel companies or forcing their hand.</p><p>&#8220;The knee-jerk reaction of licensees is to cut and run from factories,&#8221; said Cynthia Holmes, director of UCLA Trademarks &amp; Licensing. &#8220;But for us it needs to be about intense communication and corrective action. We are not so much measuring non-compliance but whether licensees are demonstrating administrative control and corrective action.&#8221;</p><p>Holmes said this approach has increased over the past four years and has enabled administrators to get a much clearer profile of the companies they work with. And it is evident in the number of licensees: Over the last four years, UCLA has cut licensee numbers from over 300 to around 170.</p><p>But while university efforts may persist, student and societal energy toward apparel issues seems to be waning. Because the issues endure, they have lost the initial glam of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/08/business/nike-shoe-plant-in-vietnam-is-called-unsafe-for-workers.html?pagewanted=all">1990&#8217;s</a>. We no longer despair at a status quo &#8211; and this hinders the types of mindsets we want consumers and companies to adopt. </p><p class="quote">&#8220;The pressure needs to be kept up,&#8221; said Holmes. &#8220;This is not an isolated trademark licensing office issue.&#8221;<br /></p><p>Holmes said companies are conditioned with a &#8220;gotcha&#8221; mentality that makes it even more difficult to actively work to address the real ethical issues, let alone without student effort. What we need is an open dialogue that provides room for change and learning &#8211; not senseless penalization.</p>
					<p>Students can drive momentum for universities to practice better ethical consumerism.<b> </b>And only then can universities effectively apply pressure to licensed apparel companies. But the enhanced negotiating power of the university only comes when students are more socially responsible.</p>
					<p>Most of the time, we just react to headline news or isolated media stories about ethical violations. But if progress with collegiate apparel companies is to move faster than at glacial pace, it needs fervor from students.</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a common outlook that the only problems that exist are those that make headline news,&#8221; said Holmes.</p>
					<p>The challenge lies in teaching students, and consumers, to build a consistent attention and commitment to ethical consumerism &#8211; within and without the apparel industry.</p>
					<p>The solution is both simple and elusive: Change our behavior.</p>
					<p>If we keep a fixed mindset about the ethical issues within industries, then they are all the less likely to change &#8211; because of us. Change occurs incrementally and collectively, but the first step in practicing ethical consumerism lies in changing the mindsets of isolated individuals.</p><p>So begin with listening to the narrative of everyday products and paying attention to the businesses on this campus. If we expect high moral standards from UCLA, then we must provide the pressure for doing so. That provision is on us.<br /></p>
					<p>Think globally, but act locally. Always.</p>
