			<h3>Spanish courses adopt hybrid format</h3>

			<h4>By Katrina Alarkon</h4>

				<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249920519&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
			</div>

			<p><b>ALARKON:</b> A few years ago, six of UCLA’s European language departments almost became one super-department in a bid to streamline the humanities.</p>
			<p>In 2009, a task force put together by then-executive vice chancellor Scott Waugh proposed to make teaching the humanities more efficient. The task force wanted to address budget cuts and improve the way UCLA taught the discipline.</p>
			<p>Changes were implemented within the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, which have affected students in introductory and intermediate courses – courses such as Spanish 1 through 5, and Spanish 7A and 7B.</p>
			<p>They’re now being taught as hybrid programs, which sees students spending more time online and less time in the classroom.</p>
			<p><b>ALARKON:</b> Ezekiel Trautenberg is a TA for Spanish 5, an intermediate-level course.</p>

			</div>

			<p><b>TRAUTENBERG: </b> We were teaching five days a week. Now we’re spending about two and a half hours in the classroom. There’s a little bit more of an online component and some of their exams are online.
			</p>
			<p><b>ALARKON:</b> He says other universities have adopted a similar approach when it comes to teaching language courses as more students sign up for them. At UCLA, it’s allowed more people to take classes that previously weren’t available to them.
			</p>
			<p><b>TRAUTENBERG: </b> I think it’s kind of inevitable as there’s more demand for language courses. What we do in the classroom hasn’t really changed but students expect it now to have some kind of online component. The real challenge is to find the balance.
			</p>
			<p><b>ALARKON:</b> Melanie Gomez is the final year of her political science major. She’s one of Trautenberg’s students and she says she completed some early Spanish classes.
			</p>
			<p><b>GOMEZ:</b> Thirty-five years ago, we didn’t have the online access. You had your book, you had your exercises in the book, and there wasn’t a lot of interactive practice.
			</p>
			<p><b>ALARKON:</b> She says the digital approach has changed the way she’s learning.
			</p>
			<p><b>GOMEZ:</b> It’s more interactive, it makes it a lot more fun, a lot more interesting. You can cover more material.
			</p>
			<p><b>ALARKON:</b> Mariska Bolyanatz says she tries to make the most of the time she’s given as a TA for Spanish 5.
			</p>
			<p>What face-to-face class time she gets gives her a chance to make sure students are getting the best learning experience possible.</p>

			<p><b>BOLYANATZ:</b> What we want to spend time on in class are what we call communicative activities. So practicing reading, or practicing speaking, or practicing listening and writing. All the things that you have to do when you communicate in a language.
			</p>
			<p><b>ALARKON:</b>She says her students have become more autonomous when it comes to learning the material she assigns.</p>

			<p><b>BOLYANATZ:</b> They have to really take responsibility for their learning process in terms of their preparation work in a way that I didn’t see my students necessarily doing before when it was a non-hybridized program.</p>

			<p><b>ALARKON:</b> … And she thinks this type of autonomy is important because...</p>

			<p><b>BOLYANATZ:</b> That’s something that I don’t think is necessarily encouraged in other classes and even perhaps in the model that we were using before. The sort of "five days a week, you come to class, I teach you what you need to know." That’s not actually how it works. You put in the work, you come into class and we practice.</p>

			<p><b>ALARKON:</b> When the proposal to merge the European language departments was announced, people worried cutting corners financially would hurt the quality of education and take away agency from smaller departments. Despite the merge being announced years ago, the six departments still stand separately today. And in the meantime, teaching these hybrid courses appears to keep this threat at bay.</p>

			<h3>Humanities enrollment remains steady amid department changes</h3>

			<h4>By Douglas Hseih</h4>

				<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249920353&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
			</div>

			<p><b>Hsieh:</b> Type in these three words into Google: “Are the humanities …” and you get a list of what people search for when they ask about the humanities. Among these suggestions include: “Are the humanities important, dying, useless.” The list goes on and on. On the surface at least, there is a serious concern over the role of the humanities in our technologically driven society.</p>

			<p>Take 2011. UCLA. The humanities division faced a severe budget deficit of $4 million to $5 million dollars. So severe that the Academic Senate proposed merging the European language departments into a single department to keep costs down.</p>

			<p>But were things as grim as they appeared? Assistant dean of the humanities, Reem Hanna-Harwell, doesn’t think so.</p>

			<p><b>Hanna-Harwell:</b>  So that particular budget problem was solved internally within the campus. And I should add, it’s not a problem that the humanities uniquely faced. It was part of a bigger problem that has been faced by most if not all of our academic units on campus. (5:28-5:57)</p>

			<div class="image">

			</div>


			<p><b>Hsieh:</b>  So if wasn’t a specific problem pertaining to the humanities, what were the actual causes of these problems?</p>

			<p><b>Hanna-Harwell:</b>  This is the main driver of those numbers. There was a structural shortfall on benefits. And also the retirement system was now requiring employers, meaning UCLA being one of the employers within the UC system, to pay into the retirement system. And these were staggering new costs for all academic units. (6:26-6:51)</p>

			<p><b>Hsieh:</b>  So according to Hannah-Harwell, what one might perceive as a trend of decline in funding of the humanities might not actually be a decline. In fact, since 2011 …</p>

			<p><b>Hanna-Harwell:</b>  I would say that funding has increased to the humanities, actually substantially. (7:17-7:22)</p>

			<p><b>Hsieh:</b>  But why? What actually drives funding in the humanities?</p>

			<p><b>Hanna-Harwell:</b> That has to do with the increase in our undergraduate student body that has happened since 2011. (7:23-7:31)</p>

			<p><b>Hsieh:</b>  But any budget would grow with more students enrolled. The real question here is: has funding in the humanities grown proportionally to other subjects?</p>

			<p><b>Hanna-Harwell:</b> Humanities have kept pace in terms of funding with other academic units on campus. (9:04 - 9:10)</p>

			<p><b>Hsieh:</b>  So what do the statistics show us? Well, according to the Office of Analysis and Information Management, from 2007 to 2013, the amount of undeclared students majoring within the humanities rose from about 270 students to 310 students. Compare that with mathematics, which grew from 855 students to 1584 students in the same span of time. So although we see a steady growth in the humanities, the humanities seem to be losing ground to the hard sciences. Professor emeritus James Catterall provides an explanation.</p>

			<p><b>Catterall:</b> The college freshman survey (15:05-15:07) Astin conducted over 35 years shows that students were becoming more and more interested in making money and less interested in doing things for personable causes. (15:13-23) Students coming in, they’re not majoring in history ... (15:45-15:47) They’re going for economics, science, mathematics, computer science, particularly information technology. They’re going where they perceive the money is and where the jobs are. (15:49-16:05)</p>

			<p><b>Hsieh:</b>  Although we see a clear trend to where students are prioritizing their education, the humanities are still growing to an extent. The diverse amount of languages we acknowledge in the European language departments are a testament to this fact.</p>

			<h3>Germanic languages department reflects on possible merger</h3>

			<h4>By Joseph Izaguirre</h4>

			<div class="audio">
				<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/249920938&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe>
			</div>

			<p><b>Izaguirre:</b> The Department of Germanic Languages here at UCLA was one of the departments slated to be merged under a proposal back in 2011. Like most humanities departments, it faced a problem: balancing the budget. One outspoken voice in the department is Robert Kirsner, professor of Dutch and Afrikaans. Kirsner recalls the feeling around the department at the time of the merger proposal.</p>

<p><b>Kirsner:</b>  The chair at the time, Jim Schultz, who is now retired was going around saying, "Department of Leftover Languages." My joke at the time was, why not call us the "Department of Un-Asian Languages"?</p>

<p><b>Izaguirre:</b>  Kirsner's opposition to the merger is rooted in his love for language. As a linguist, he emphasizes the importance of language in personal connection:</p>

			<div class="image">

			</div>

<p><b>Kirsner:</b> Languages are important. They're the way you get to the insides of people.</p>

<p><b>Izaguirre:</b>  Kirsner noted a trend: Americans nowadays are sheltered from foreign languages. American news channels use voice overs rather than subtitles, exposing the viewer to English only. American films used to give more exposure to foreign languages. In the 1951 film "The Day the Earth Stood Still," there is a scene where the world reacts to a flying saucer approaching Earth.</p>

<p><b>Kirsner:</b> And when the flying saucer approaches Earth, and people on earth are getting scared and notice it, you have news broadcasts in Hindi, and then in French, and then in British English, and then American English. In the remake with Keanu Reaves, which, ahem, sucks, it's only English. It's changed that way, you see how American culture has changed that way.</p>

<p><b>Izaguirre:</b>  Kirsner has a possible solution to the budget problem. He believes that the humanities could make a profit with a project called "Digital Humanities," headed by the Germanic languages department's own professor Todd Presner.</p>

<p><b>Kirsner:</b> I think there is money in there. Software development, developing software to analyze texts.</p>

<p><b>Izaguirre:</b>  Kirsner's colleague, John McCumber, is a distinguished professor of Germanic languages and the chair of the Germanic languages department. He believes that a language department merger would be a good idea. He recalls the change in attitude that the department has undergone since the proposal back in 2011.</p>

<p><b>McCumber:</b> That was several years ago, and I would say that there were people who were opposed. There's not so much opposition now to that.</p>

<p><b>Izaguirre:</b>  According to McCumber, a merger would encourage a holistic view of subjects which were once isolated. This would lead to a better understanding of each subject. And if done correctly, the loss of the Department of Germanic Languages would not hurt UCLA.</p>

<p><b>McCumber:</b> If we do it in the right way, I don't think that the reputation would be hurt, I think actually that it will go up because it will provide a way for people to see Germany in context.</p>

<p><b>Izaguirre:</b>  McCumber believes that the humanities are changing, and that UCLA needs to change with them. As the world becomes more interconnected, teaching a subject in isolation is no longer feasible.</p>

<p><b>McCumber:</b> As a philosopher, I know that the standard way of teaching German philosophy was to pretend as if no German ever read an English philosopher or Chinese philosopher, or anything like that. It just doesn’t work. We’re looking at these new approaches that help us do a better job of communicating what we have to communicate.</p>

<p><b>Izaguirre:</b>  But merged or not, the Department of Germanic Languages will continue to impart the German language and culture on students who seek it out.</p>
