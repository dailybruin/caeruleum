                <h3>Teaching audio recording classes, off the record</h3>

                <p class="video-explainer">Behind nondescript doors, deep within UCLA’s School of Theater, Film and Television, are specialized rooms filled with thousands of dollars of recording equipment, where film department production staff Beth Sweeney and David McKenna offer unofficial classes on audio engineering. These classes can accommodate only about 10 students per quarter. They remain relatively unknown to the rest of UCLA, almost to the point of secrecy, being promoted mostly by fliers or word of mouth. The courses, including Introduction to Recording Engineering and Level Two Recording Engineering, give students of all majors hands-on experience in recording sound. The classes are designed to allow students access to recording equipment in Melnitz Hall and to foster a passion for the field of audio engineering.</p>

                <p class="video-explainer">Behind the scenes and in front of the microphone, third-year physics student, Kyle Kuwatani, and third-year environmental science student, Kyle Graycar, have learned how to use the audio engineering equipment in Melnitz Hall by recording their own music. The pair enrolled in the introductory class to expand their knowledge of audio engineering, and eventually to record some of their own songs from their band, Manzanita.</p>

The second-year ethnomusicology student is working to record a band's album. After taking both the Intro and Level Two Recording Engineering classes, Yoo now uses his audio engineering skills to run a business.</p>
