<p class="cc-note">UCLA women's basketball coach Cori Close (left) and UCLA women's soccer coach Amanda Cromwell (right) have a friendship dating back nearly two decades after the two met volunteering as coaches at a camp for female high school athletes.</p>
</div>

<div id="cc-container">
<p><b>BY AUBREY YEO</b>
<p>
<p>Nestled between the pages of Amanda Cromwell’s Bible is a handwritten letter.
<p>
<p>On the bottom right of the note, penned in blue ink, is the name of the person who proudly proclaims herself the UCLA women’s soccer coach’s “psycho fan.”
<p>
<p>Cromwell’s time as a professional soccer player made her a seasoned traveler. Her career has taken her to Georgia, California and the nation’s capital to name a few places.
<p>
<p>At each stop, one particular fan was there, keeping an attentive eye from the stands on the former U.S. Women’s National Team player.
<p>
<p>Today, this admirer keeps this tradition alive in Westwood. This season, she watched from the stands of Drake Stadium as Cromwell’s players thanked the soccer coach for leading them to their first Pac-12 championship win with a generous splash of Powerade.
<p>
<p>UCLA women's basketball coach Cori Close might be a recognizable face in the stands, but one thing few know about this self-proclaimed "psycho fan" is her role in nudging Cromwell to move to Westwood.
<p>
<p>“Getting the job here or interviewing for the job here, I really looked to (Close) for advice and just kind of used her as a sounding board for sharing,” Cromwell said.
<p>
<p>The two coaches have only been together a few months at UCLA, but their story goes much further back.
<p>
<p><span class="cc-headline">Forging a friendship</span>
<p>
<p>Cromwell leans back in her office chair. The coach takes a slight pause before finishing her answer.
<p>
<p>“It was late '90s, probably '90 – what did she say? '96 or '97 probably? I don’t know what she said, but go with one of them,” Cromwell said, laughing and trying to remember when she first met Close.
<p>
<p>When posed with the same question, Close ponders while she looks out over the hardwood floor of Pauley Pavilion, before committing to the same rough window of time.
<p>
<p>The details of when they first became friends might be hard to recall, but when prompted to discuss their history both coaches start speaking rapidly, as if empowered by a sudden burst of clarity.
<p>
<p>Close was a veteran volunteer coach at the Fellowship of Christian Athletes when the two first met. She already accrued a resume of running several years’ worth of the Fellowship's basketball camps at UC Santa Barbara and was looking forward to another summer.
<p>
<p>By contrast, Cromwell was a newbie, but one that the camp was excited to welcome; a newbie who juggled coaching soccer at University of Central Florida with a position on the U.S. Women’s National Team.
<p>
<p>To use Close’s terms, Cromwell was “a big dog soccer player.”
<p>
<p>But there was one passion they shared that overshadowed their dichotomous positions within the organization. It was the same ambition  that would motivate them to voluntarily give up precious off-season time year after year.
<p>
<p>"We both loved using sports to impact people," Close said. "We don’t get paid to work (at Fellowship of Christian Athletes) camps, we do it because we love the opportunity that sports gives us to impact people."
<p>
<p>And that connection was enough to convince the Florida-based Cromwell to commit to volunteering beyond her first year.
<p>
<p>"I remember Amanda would come back every year, and she was coming from Florida, so she had a long ways to come,” said Debbie Haliday, who at the time was director of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes camps. “So I think that the draw was the people and the friendships that were growing.”
<p>
<p>But a shared love for the sport that the other represented certainly didn’t hurt.
<p>
<p>“She actually grew up playing basketball, like I grew up playing soccer,” Close said. "She grew up playing basketball, and I think just ended up being a little better at soccer and so she went that direction. I ended up being a little better at basketball (and) went that direction.”
<div class="cc-quote-block">
    <p class="cc-left-quote">"</p>
    <p id="quote3" class="cc-quote">
    I think they’re two of the most competitive people I know so everything turns into a competition. Fishing becomes a competition even, and so it’s fun to…watch them kind of go at each other and compete. At the camp everyone would play basketball and then everyone would go play soccer…and those two (would be) right in the mix of that, kind of ringleaders for that and (they) would love to give each other a hard time if the other one won soccer or basketball.

<p>
<p>Whenever Close was on a recruiting trip near a city Cromwell was scheduled to play in, there would always be one additional item on her travel itinerary – visiting a stadium on game day.
<p>
<p>“She’s one of the best defenders in the world, literally, she’s a World Cup level player,” Close said. “To follow her professional career, it was just fun. It was fun to support her; it was fun to be her little psycho fan.”
<div class="cc-quote-block">
    <p class="cc-left-quote">"</p>
    <p id="quote1" class="cc-quote">
    She’s got a nickname… (and) her nickname is ‘Sal’. And every time I’m like ‘Hey, Sal!’ down the hall, she’ll turn around and people will be like ‘Who are you calling Sal?” Well when she was with the national team, they were down in Brazil, and it was this Salamander, and it become ‘Salamanda’ and it got shortened to ‘Sal’….So most of the people with USA Soccer call her Sal. But people around here think I’m crazy when I do that.

<p>
<p>But even elite athletes have bad days. For Cromwell, one such day came in July of 2003.
<p>
<p>A defender for the now-defunct San Jose CyberRays, Cromwell didn’t perform up to her expectations during a match. Her coach decided to take her out of the game. And to add to her growing list of frustrations, her team lost.
<p>
<p>After the game, Cromwell picked up her Bible and found inside it a handwritten note Close had left there after the loss.
<div class="cc-img">
    <img class="cc-round" src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2014/02/Note-with-writing.jpeg" alt=""></img>
</div>
<p>
<p>“She knew how much I was … eaten up because of that situation. … The level of competitiveness is through the roof; it’s different for (coaches), and we can empathize for each other,” Cromwell said. 
<p>
<p>For Close, it was nothing more than a sincere attempt to do what she loved – encouraging people.
<p>
<p>What Cromwell saw from the gesture, however, was a thoughtful gift from a friend – one that she’d cherish and keep in pristine condition for more than a decade.
<p>
<p>And in just a year, Cromwell would get a chance to repay Close's favor in a big way.
<p>
<p><span class="cc-headline">"A lifelong friend"</span>
<p>
<p>In early June 2004, Close, the newly appointed associate head coach of the Florida State Seminoles, made the journey from California to the East Coast. She was ready to take on the challenge of leading a new women’s basketball program.
<p>
<div class="cc-quote-block">
    <p class="cc-left-quote">"</p>
    <p id="quote4" class="cc-quote">
    When I was helping (Cori) when she was in Tallahassee tryin to find a place to live, she was a crazy person driving around. We’d be on the left side of the road, and she would see this sign for an open house on the right, and she would cross three lanes of traffic and fly in to see this one open house. I felt like we were just driving around like a bat out of hell. It was fun, we look back on that and laugh.
    </p>
    <p class="cc-right-quote">"</p>
    <p class="quoter"> – Amanda Cromwell</p>
</div>
<p>But no amount of preparation could have readied Close for what she faced on her first day on the job.
<p>
<p>An aneurysm had taken the life of the team's 19-year-old starting center Ronalda Pierce.
<p>
<p>The pressures that came with relocating cross-country for a new job were now compounded with the fact that the players she inherited were grieving for their teammate and friend. 
<p>
<p>Close needed to comfort them. She needed to get them back on their feet, ready for the Seminoles' summer training camp.
<p>
<p>But she needed someone too; she needed a friend. She made a phone call.
<p>
<p>“I’m down in Orlando … and (Close) calls me at six in the morning,” Cromwell said. “I knew something was wrong.”
<p>
<p>Cromwell’s response to the phone call was as swift as her ability to assess her friend’s situation. Without hesitation, she made the nearly four-hour drive from Orlando to Tallahassee to answer the call for help.
<p>
<p>Using a blend of her residual knowledge as a high school state champion point guard, naturally mixed with her expertise as an associate head coach of the University of Central of Florida's soccer program, Cromwell injected a bit of her personality into the camp’s program.
<p>
<p>That amalgamation of the two different games created a series of hybrid drills whose legacy still stands today – a legacy that Close intends to continue with her future basketball camps.
<p>
<p>“Maybe I’ll have to bring her back to do them this summer,” she said, jokingly.
<p>
<p>But the biggest impression Cromwell left on Close wasn’t on her playbook.
<p>
<p>“Probably at that point I knew she was a lifelong friend,” Close said.
<p>
<p><span class="cc-headline">Becoming a Bruin</span>
<p>
<p>Even a few years ago, Close, who started at UCLA in 2011, would have had a hard time believing both her and Cromwell would be reunited in Westwood.
<p>
<p>The time the two spent together gave Close privileged access to the most recent developments regarding which NCAA powerhouses were offering her friend job offers. But as Cromwell's confidant, Close also knew that only two jobs could really pique Cromwell’s interest enough to consider leaving UCF – UCLA and Virginia.

<p>But even then, Close always gave the upper hand to the Virginia Cavaliers, Cromwell’s alma mater.
<p>
<p>When the UCLA job opened up in 2013, Cromwell stayed true to her word and turned in her resume. But Close would add one final complementary piece to the list of her friend's accolades: A sincere letter written to Athletic Director Dan Guerrero on behalf of her friend; a letter that once again showcased Close’s ability to leave deep impressions on people using her words.
<p>
<p>“I think very highly of Cori Close, and for her to make a recommendation of another coach resonated with me,” Guerrero said. “Whenever you bring someone in, it’s obviously a huge advantage if someone who you respect knows another individual, and in this case, it was Cori who had a prior relationship with Amanda.”
<p>
<p>After a long day of interviewing at UCLA, there was still one person Cromwell wanted to see before she had to temporarily bid farewell to Los Angeles.
<p>
<p>The two planned to meet on campus, and as Close spotted her friend pulling up near the Los Angeles Tennis Center, Cromwell's body language gave away her impressions of UCLA before any of her words could.
<p>
<p>There was no doubt in Close’s mind now.
<p>
<p>“I was going right around the bend of Pauley Pavilion, and I could see her about 70 yards away, and I could see her smiling from there,” Close said. “And I said to myself ‘she wants this job.’”
<p>
<p>Cromwell got the job. The final piece of the puzzle for a Fellowship of Christian Athletes reunion was finally in place.

<p>
<p>Haliday, whom UCLA hired just a year ago, got a chance to see the two coaches join forces once again. And the reaction she provided was one only capable of being elucidated by someone who’s known them for the longest time.
<p>
<p>“It feels like family coming together,” she said.
<p>
<p><span class="cc-headline">Los Angeles legacy</span>
<p>
<p>Cromwell's predecessor had departed abruptly, and among the players the initial surprise gave way to uncertainty about a new coach.
<p>
<p>And just as Cromwell answered Close's call for help years before, lending her experience to the Seminoles' women's basketball team, Close was quick to assuage the team's reservations.
<p>
<p>A chance encounter between Close and junior defenders Caprice Dydasco and Megan Oyster at a food line during a scholarship banquet let Close overhear the soccer players’ concerns about their new coach. It also gave Close a chance to play the part of Cromwell’s "psycho fan" once again.
<p>
<p>A tap on the shoulder later, Close started to reveal to the players more about their new coach than any well-crafted Google search ever could, replacing those concerns with hope.
<p>
<p>And once again, Close’s words delivered.
<p>
<p>“(Cromwell) lived up to her expectations of being really nice and a players’ coach,” Dydasco said.
<div class="cc-quote-block">
    <p class="cc-left-quote">"</p>
    <p id="quote2" class="cc-quote">
    One thing we always would kid around with Cori, you know that book ‘The Purpose Driven Life’? … I always thought Cori is so determined and dedicated and she’s just all on point all the time, and so I’ll just joke around that she’s getting from point A to point B. So I would joke around and say she has the purpose driven walk. Like she’s just walking and she has a purpose and you can say that about everything in her life. And so that’s what she probably brings out of me, a little bit about having more of a purpose and knowing ‘These are my goals’ and ‘How do I get there?’…She brings out of me wanting to be a better coach and wanting to get the most out of this program as I can.

<p>
<p>That wouldn’t be the last time Close got a chance to   play fan at UCLA.
<p>
<p>In a new tradition, Cromwell now makes it a point to immerse potential recruits in the culture of UCLA athletics via a women's basketball game in Pauley Pavilion, introducing her prospective players to her good friend.
<p>
<p> “(Close is) one of my biggest fans,” Cromwell said. “If I bring her around anybody she just goes on and on and just gushes about me.”

<p>
<p>Today the coaches continue to pen the new chapter in their friendship that started close to 20 years ago – an endearing and enduring friendship that began because of the love they shared for molding the next generation of athletes.
<p>
<p>It's the same reason they both don blue and gold to this day.
