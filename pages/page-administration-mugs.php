    <h1 id="main-title">Introduction to UCLA Leadership</h1>
    <p>Vice chancellors and the chancellor are the highest levels of UCLA&#39;s administrative structure. Chancellor Gene Block is at the top of the hierarchy and is in charge of fulfilling the university&#39;s mission. Below Block is Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Scott Waugh who directly oversees the nine vice chancellors. Each of the nine vice chancellors supervises a specific aspect of campus, with some doing behind-the-scenes work, such as legal affairs, and others doing work that engages students directly, such as in student affairs.</p>
